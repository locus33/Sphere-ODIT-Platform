Currently this product has been under development for over 3 months now (stated @ march 27 2024), and our goal is to bring a slightly different approach to this new evolving market, 
with "the idea or concept" of making a tool that is constantly expandable with plugins/upgrades so that as this product/products/project expands any one 
who invests in SPHERE or allied projects/products should get more than just a piece of software or tool but also the ability to also get custom 
features, exploits, and even workflow design to make your investication smoother and faster when exporting/formating data for your investigation report documentation.
("tell us what you want, what you need!!!", "make a real world senario with the "5 W's" and we can collectively develope different vectors to gathering 
information silently with out the investigated subject or subjects getting any concept of entrusion.  
In our field of information gathering, the more complacentcy, and less "FUD" (fear, uncertanty and distrust) the more easly information and be collected.
Attatched is a series lab demo pictures showing some of the features.
Please contact through github for more information untill the website will be avalible when we launch.
