Currently this product has been under development for over 3 months now (stated @ march 27 2024), and our goal is to bring a slightly different approach to this new evolving market, 
with "the idea or concept" of making a tool that is constantly expandable, with plugins/upgrades so that as this product/products/project expands any one 
who invests in SPHERE © or allied projects/products should get more than just a piece of software. More than a tool, but also the ability to get custom 
features, exploits to workflow design, makeing your investication smoother and faster when exporting/formating the data for your investigation report.
tell us what you want and what you need!!!, make a real world senario with the "5 W's" and we can collectively develope different vectors to gathering 
information silently with out the investigated subject or subjects getting any concept of entrusion.  
In the field of information gathering, the more complacentcy, and less "FUD" (fear, uncertanty and distrust) the more easly information and be collected.
Attatched is a series lab demo pictures showing some of the features.
Please contact through github comment section or telegram listed below for more information untill the website will be avalible to launch. 
If you are interested in Investing / are interested in this product/project or other custom product/product ideas in this catigory (investigative/intelligence tools) 
We would be happy to colaberate and help with any ideas from concept to final product from software to hardeware solutions, we got you covered.
